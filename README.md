# Fansubs.cat

Website and backend services for www.fansubs.cat, a site that shows news from all Catalan fansubs.

## Why this site?

There are several Catalan fansubs and I thought that it would be cool to have them all centralized on one site.
With this site, you can take a quick look and see if there are any news on any of the fansub sites.
Links are disabled in order to not steal visitors from the original fansub pages, thus forcing the user to go to their page in order to be able to access the latest releases.
Of course, the site is completely non-profit and will always remain like that.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. This is a collaborative project! :)

## How does it work?

The site is run on a very simple machine with Debian Stretch, with an Apache 2.4 + PHP 7.0 + MariaDB 10.1 server.
The site allows displaying and filtering of the news database, and the news are inserted into the database by web scraping the different fansub websites.
Take a look at the code if you want to know more! :)
